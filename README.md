###### Usage: Ever forget your password for a zip file you created? Use this program to find out what it was! Go ahead and test it on 'sample.zip'

This program attempts to crack your zip file/folder by trying every key in 'dictionary.txt'. If your password isn't in the dictionary, unzipper will fail.
